        In this workshop, we will explore ‚Äúenergy spheres‚Äù (radial gradient
        portraits of people, places, or things) through creating them as gifts
        for friends or family using a prototype of a new tool. In doing so, we
        will attempt to transform the traditional circular image format often
        used online, such as in phone contacts, profile pictures, avatars, etc.,
        into an a more resonant and poetic experience ‚Äî similar to an aura
        portrait.

          Some background: In 2019, artist Elliott Cost published a
          <a href="https://sites.elliott.computer/contacts/">contacts page</a>
          on his website, which extended into corresponding avatars in his phone
          and computer's Contacts app. Since then, they have been continued by
          Laurel in
          <a href="https://laurelschwulst.com/medium/interest/energy-spheres"
            >various forms</a
          >, including making a prototype of a sphere-making tool in
          collaboration with <a href="https://soft.works">Soft</a>. Energy
          Spheres also exist as natural phenomena (like full rainbows) in the
          world, and have been explored by artists in various forms previously,
          as documented in an ongoing

      <p>In this workshop, we will explore compiling a private Are.na channel (collection of things) as a gift for someone specific, as outlined <a href="https://www.are.na/block/26355601" target="_blank">here</a>. What makes a good gift, and how can we transmit this digitally? We'll explore various formats and starting points for considering your Are.na channel as a gift, as well as working time and dialogue.</p>

          Some background: With Are.na, Laurel began the <a href="https://www.are.na/editorial/gift-shop-talk" target="_blank">Are.na Gift Shop</a> a couple years ago. A timeless question we've been asking ourselves is... what makes a good gift? Cab says, "the best gift is when it‚Äôs something you want and you‚Äôre positive that the other person would want it too, because you can feel there‚Äôs an overlap of what you can both feel excited about." Meg reflects, "I think good gift givers are also very good at listening and then remembering that one thing you said that one time about wanting something." Anyway, it's nice to think that others are keeping you in mind while going about their everyday lives.

        In this workshop, Laurel will lead participants through ideas of how to
        consider a calendar as a gift. Specifically, we'll create a digital
        Google Calendars for the year 2025 as a gift for friends or family. We
        will also explore how Google Calendar can not only be used for
        logistical planning, but also become an everyday, ambient surface to
        archive, view, and circle back to special images, writing, and memories.

          Some background: We believe Google Calendar is a vastly unexplored surface for gifting, publishing, and expression. In the context of this workshop, we'll explore gifting. In the year 2020, Laurel along with <a href="http://lauracoombs.com">Laura Coombs</a> and <a href="http://mindyseu.com">Mindy Seu</a> worked together on a surprise birthday gift (among other projects). This gift was a time capsule of memories from friends and family for the next year, assembled as a Google Calendar. We are also inspired by the work of <a href="https://whitespreadsheet.online/">whitespreadsheet.online</a>, who hosts workshops exploring expressive possibilities for Google Spreadsheets. And <a href="https://websitesite.xyz/">Jisu Lee</a> explores digital calendars regularly, as the image in the flier is a screenshot from her forthcoming 2025 calendar. We want to host a workshop so you can use Google Calendar as a container for gifting, and we can consider other possibilities for ways to express gratitude through time and everyday tools.
